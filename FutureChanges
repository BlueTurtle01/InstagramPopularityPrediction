collect_media_total()
    Change the results.append to a dictionary append method as it will be quicker. I did not change this as it was near
    the end of the project and I wanted to avoid causing a lasting error so close to the deadline.
calculate_sat() / calculate_hue()
    Specify the type error I am trying to except
age_of_image()
    Change the variable name 'date'. It did not cause me any problems but given it's common internal use by Python I think
    it may do in future and would be good practice to change it.
